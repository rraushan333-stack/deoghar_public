          <p>
            Founded in 2014 by a group of educators who believed school should
            be a place of genuine discovery, SchoolLanding has grown into one of
            the region's most respected institutions — known not just for exam
            results, but for the quality of people it graduates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our big campus, dedicated faculty members, and decades of refined
            pedagogy create an environment where every student finds their
            voice, their discipline, and their direction.
